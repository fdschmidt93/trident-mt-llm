# trident-xtreme: data

This folder is a host of as least required data as possible; ideally, any datasets required are sourced from Huggingface [datasets](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/).

Only very small datasets (<1MB or preferrably less) will be added.

Exceptions include:
- COPA: part of [Super Glue](https://huggingface.co/datasets/super_glue) which does not have any labels for the test split
